<div style="one">Some of it is visual.</div>

<div style="two">Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a personal
blog: They are collected in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web addresses to each post.</div>

<div style="three">But I have very little control over how it looks like; I can’t personalize it much.</div>

<div style="four">My page must follow a uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for me.</div>

<div style="four">The centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for things to disappear.</div>

<div style="five">After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn’t able to pay its
   monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server.</div>

<div style="six">(Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to
  your own web space, whereas now most platforms don’t let you so.)</div>

<div style="seven">Even if I didn’t, the Internet archive might keep a copy.</div>

    <blockquote style=""><b><em>But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason?</b></em></blockquote>

<div style="eight">Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many American
    services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions.</div>

<div style="nine">If that happened,I might be able to download my posts in some of them, and let’s assume the backup can be easily imported into another
    platform. But what about the unique web address for my social network profile?</div>

<div style="ten">Would I be able to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and more clear— especially
      since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.</div>

<div style="eleven">But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social networks is something else: It is making us all
       much less powerful in relation to governments and corporations.</div>
